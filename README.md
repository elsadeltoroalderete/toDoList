# Build a To Do List
## What's this project about?
This project is about creating an "To Do" list by separating its elements by different files.

## How to Run: 
- Get sure you download five files:
   ·  index.html
   ·  index.js
   ·  form.js
   ·  todo.js
   ·  styles.css
- Be sure in the index.html file are linked the other files, specially if you decide to change the names of the other files.
- In the index.js file you'll find the babel and react components, also the id "root" for app ReactDom element.
- The form.js has the code for the form and the event that prevents the app refreshes by default.
- The function that allows the user to remove an item in the to do list is in the todo.js file.
- Finally, in the styles.css file, is where the style of the to do list is defined.
- If you can not visualize correctly the to do list, please go to you computer terminal and go to the directory where this five files are in your local network and run the command "npx serve", when the process ends, node will return a server for you to test the code, so you can go to the browser and use that server to open the app.
  
## What's next?
Experiment by aapplying this kind of forms / React App to other use cases, and also styling the To Do list for different type of users.
